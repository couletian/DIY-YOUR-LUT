# 胶片工坊 / Film Studio

[中文](README.md) · **English** · [日本語](README.ja.md)

An unofficial film-look experiment for the **Sony a5100 / ILCE-5100**. It references the hardware color-processing approach in [bonyback1's Ricoh mod](https://github.com/bonyback1/sony-pmca-ricoh-mod) and uses [Fujifilm's publicly available GFX ETERNA 55 LUTs](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/global/support/download/lut/) as color-research references for photographs and experimental video.

**Published: 0.2.0-alpha (on-camera 0.2a). Local development: 0.3.0-alpha (0.3a), not yet published or hardware-tested.** The app is named 胶片工坊 / Film Studio. Documentation is available in three languages; the camera UI is currently primarily Chinese. Download links below still point to the available 0.2.0 release.

**Version 0.2.0 renamed the app to Film Studio (胶片工坊), combining ten Fujifilm-reference and five upstream Ricoh/street-style presets, fifteen in total.** Menu labels use 富士 / 理光 prefixes. The package and signing certificate are retained for an in-place update from 富士风格. The combined build installed and launched on the a5100, with successful parameter-application logs for selected presets; saved photographs/video from 0.2.0 remain unverified. [0.1.3-alpha](https://github.com/ukiki0718-netizen/sony-a5100-film-studio/releases/tag/v0.1.3-alpha) remains available for rollback.

## Camera compatibility

**Only the a5100 has been tested by this project. This app does not work with every Sony camera.**

| Model | Status in this project |
| --- | --- |
| **a5100 / ILCE-5100, firmware 1.10** | Tested within the feature/version limits documented below |
| a6000, a6300, a6500 | PMCA candidates listed upstream; this version is untested |
| a7, a7R, a7S, a7 II, a7R II, a7S II | PMCA candidates listed upstream; this version is untested |
| RX100 III/IV/V, RX10 II/III, RX1R II, HX90 | PMCA candidates listed upstream; this version is untested |
| a6400, a6700, a7 III, a7C | Do not support the PlayMemories Camera Apps installation platform required here |
| Other models or firmware | Not assessed; a similar model name does not establish compatibility |

Candidates come from the [upstream model list](https://github.com/bonyback1/sony-pmca-ricoh-mod/blob/7c565898562c73c5073c54dfc831c8c3df9c24cf/README.md), not tests of this project's added video and strength features. PMCA is the on-camera app platform required here; MTP or phone remote control alone does not establish PMCA support.

**The current video menu follows a5100 specifications and includes no 4K choices.** It does not promise every native format, frame rate or bitrate on other models. Successful installation must be followed by separate checks of preview, look selection, JPEG persistence, recording start/stop, saved-video playback and color reset after exit. Actual colors may differ across models. Reports should identify model, firmware, app version and exactly what was tested.

## Download and installation

**[Download APK: 0.2.0-alpha](https://github.com/ukiki0718-netizen/sony-a5100-film-studio/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha/FilmStudio-0.2.0-alpha-movie.apk)** · [Release notes and checksum files](https://github.com/ukiki0718-netizen/sony-a5100-film-studio/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha)

Download `FilmStudio-0.2.0-alpha-movie.apk`, then follow the [English installation guide](docs/INSTALL.en.md) to connect and install. No local compilation is required. **Code → Download ZIP contains source, not the installer.**

This is an unofficial experimental release with only the a5100 evidence described above. The APK contains Sony base-app material and parameters fitted from publicly available Fujifilm LUTs. A separate grant to adapt and redistribute those third-party materials has not been established. Publication does not represent Sony/FUJIFILM permission or guarantee immunity; [license scope](LICENSING.md) distinguishes the rights in each part. Original official LUT files and signing private keys are not distributed.

→ **[Complete English installation guide](docs/INSTALL.en.md)**: inputs → local build → first-time connection → Wi-Fi ADB installation → camera controls → updates and troubleshooting.

With your own lawfully built local 0.3.0 APK and Wi-Fi ADB already enabled:

```sh
adb connect CAMERA_IP:5555
adb -s CAMERA_IP:5555 install -r output/FilmStudio-0.3.0-alpha-movie.apk
```

**IP address and privacy:** `CAMERA_IP` is a placeholder. Replace it with the current IP shown on your own camera in Tweak → Developer; do not type the placeholder literally or copy someone else's address. Keep the `:5555` port. Public instructions use a placeholder; hide or remove actual IP addresses before sharing screenshots or logs.

First-time users also need the preparation steps in the guide.

### Does the APK recipient need to compile anything?

**No. A signed APK can be installed through the documented procedure; runtime compatibility still depends on the camera and environment.** Recipients do not need Python, Java, Apktool or the private signing key. The local build chapters are for modifying or generating an APK yourself; doing so does not itself resolve third-party permissions.

## Changes in the local 0.3.0 development build

- The filter browser keeps the live camera image visible. Move with the directional buttons or dial and pause to preview; press center to confirm, or back/cancel to restore the look active when the browser opened. Confirm before taking a photograph or pressing MOVIE.
- Rapid browsing applies only the last highlighted choice after a 120 ms debounce. This delay is a code setting, not a measured camera response time.
- Fifteen different color-and-letter badges help identify the looks. They are identifiers, not sample photographs.
- Each look/strength matrix and curve pair loads on first selection and is reused, instead of initializing every combination at startup. All existing color parameters for fifteen looks and four strengths are preserved.

**These changes have not been tested on a camera.** Live preview, cancellation, saved photographs/video, and startup/switching times still need verification in this build. No measured speedup is claimed. The downloadable 0.2.0 APK does not include these additions.

## Features

- Ten Fujifilm official-LUT reference looks: PROVIA, Velvia, ASTIA, CLASSIC CHROME, REALA ACE, PRO Neg. Std, CLASSIC Neg., ETERNA, ETERNA BLEACH BYPASS and ACROS.
- Five upstream Ricoh/street styles: GR Positive Film, Negative Film, High Contrast B&W, Moriyama Daido Style and Cross Process. Community presets, not official Ricoh LUTs.
- Press the center button to select a look in still preview or movie standby.
- MENU page 1 →「滤镜强度」(filter strength): **30%, 50%, 70%, 100%**. Starts at 100%; shared by stills and video and saved through normal app exit.
- MENU page 1 →「拍照／录像模式」(still/movie mode) → movie P/A/S/M, then「录像文件格式」(format) and「录像帧率／画质」(frame rate/quality). Choices follow the camera's supported XAVC S, AVCHD and MP4 profiles and current PAL/NTSC system.
- MOVIE starts/stops recording. Look and strength stay fixed during recording.
- White balance remains available on MENU page 4. The app uses STD/Standard with contrast, saturation and sharpness at zero as its baseline; native Portrait/Vivid Creative Styles are not stacked in this app.
- Separate package `com.yuki.imaging.app.pictureeffectplus`, allowing coexistence with the original Ricoh mod.

For portraits, compare 30% and 50% first. Strength reduces both the color matrix and tone curve; it does not detect faces or automatically repair skin tones. **ACROS, Ricoh High Contrast B&W and Moriyama style retain some color below 100%. Use 100% for monochrome.**

## Evidence and limits

Tested on one **a5100, firmware 1.10, Android 2.3.7 / API 10**. Other models are not promised to work.

- 0.1.1: all ten look selections applied; PROVIA color and ACROS monochrome JPEGs saved; an ACROS XAVC S 1080p59.94 clip saved and fully decoded.
- 0.1.2: the user confirmed format/quality menus were usable. Every encoded format has not been inspected.
- 0.1.3: installation, startup and default-look application verified; the user gave general confirmation of the new controls. Every look/strength/format combination has not been tested in saved media.

**In-app playback currently lists photographs only.** Exit to native playback and choose the appropriate XAVC S, AVCHD or MP4 view to see movies. See [validation notes](docs/VALIDATION.md).

This is not a complete port of Fujifilm's in-camera Film Simulation. F-Log2/F-Gamut LUTs cannot be applied directly to ordinary Sony imagery. The fitting process uses WDR-709 as a proxy neutral reference, producing a 3×3 matrix and a common 1024-point curve. The a5100 has not been color-calibrated for this model; grain and sensor response are not simulated, and some looks have substantial approximation error.
